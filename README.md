# password-generator-project
My password generator app that generates a password, copies it to your clipboard and saves it to a JSON file to your computer. All built with python using tkinter gui with search functionality.
The code catches exceptions and error handling. Especially for new users and no file is found.
This app is great for people that don't feel comfortable saving password on the cloud and would rather have them saved locally on their computer.
